I developed a new version of the Lion's Roar's Copy Flow System in the spring of 2013. The system allows newspaper editors and reporters to organize, write, edit, and publish articles as well as keep track of various print and web page interfaces during the production and publication of the newspaper.

The application is based in PHP, and runs Bootstrap. See changelog for more information.

The CFS is currently live at thelionsroar.com/cfs
