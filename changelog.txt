1.11.13- 2.0 beta 2
-Updated text editor! From 8:00 PM EST January 11th on, every new article and every currently unwritten article on CFS(both 1 and 2) will use the new CKeditor. This editor supports bold, italicizing, spellcheck, and a lot of new features which will allow better editing in general. 
-Keep in mind that the editor still cannot autosave your article, so heavy editing/writing articles on CFS is still not advised.
-On the other hand, italicizing, bolding and other style formats will be saved into the database. 
-Old articles, due to compatibility with paragraph breaks, will still use the old textbox editor.

12.5.12- 1.3.0- MAJOR UPDATE

-Encrypted all passwords for CFS as a security measure. Passwords on the database are no longer stored in plaintext. Hurrah!

-NEW FEATURE: Added registering on CFS! Click "register" from the login screen to register a new account. All new accounts created this way will send an email(through James's Email Robot) to me, so any unauthorized or suspicious registrations can be deleted. Moreover, all new registered users start out as "reporter" and cannot modify their role without admin or senior staff. 

-NEW FEATURE: Added changing account information! Now, at the bottom toolbar, a new link called "Change Account Info" will allow you to change your name, email, password, etc. It will NOT allow you to change your role or section. This right is reserved to admins and senior staff through user edit. You must type in your password in order to make any changes, for security reasons. Please remember to do so each time, or else it'll yell at you.


-NEW FEATURE: Bio information! Now, from the Change Account Info box, you can add a little "about me" statement- known as Profile Information(newly registering users can also add one). Anything in the text box will be displayed on your own profile on the Roar website. Please refrain from writing any vulgar or otherwise inappropriate words.

- NEW FEATURE: Pictures! Underneath the Profile Information box, there is a box to let you fill in a link to a photo of yourself, which will be displayed on the Roar website.
Steps to add a photo to your profile:
Find a photo of you, on a website(such as facebook).
Right click, say copy image URL, or words to that effect. (If such a button does not exist, say "open image in new tab" then copy EVERYTHING in your address bar).
Go the CFS and paste the link exactly as it says.
Go to your Roar profile. Hopefully it worked!
Tell me if there's any issues here. For an example, click on the link to "James" above.

- Lots of bug fixes
- Made system more secure to MYSQL Injection attacks
- This may be the last big feature patch before I have to hand in my final project, so the next few patches will be 1.3.x, and have small edits, but no major additions. I need to make sure all my code is polished before submission! If you find any bugs or anything at all, please tell me! I won't be offended, I promise!


12.4.12 - 1.2.2

-Almost completely destroyed CFS. Almost.
-Increased number of backups being made from 0 to infinity
-Added new "Photographer" feature for articles. If you fill out the "Photographer" section on CFS, instead of saying "Photo Req'd" on the articles-list, CFS will name the photographer assigned to that photo. Photos and Graphics have been updated as well.

12.3.12 - 1.2.1
-Vastly increased performance and decreased loading times on section pages
-Validated all pages via W3 standards(to an extent)
-Fixed many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many bugs


12.1.12 - 1.2.0

-Added user support for thelionsroar.com! Go to any article, and any user that is registered on CFS will appear as a link. Clicking on the link will lead to a list of articles the user has written, as well as the user's name, yog and position on the Roar.
-example: thelionsroar.com/reporter.php automatically defaults to Joe Joseph.
-Because of this change, "Editor In Chief" is now a role on CFS. Editors in Chief have the same privileges as Administrators. Joe and Jenny have already been updated.

-This means that both titles and authors of articles should have the full names of the reporters who wrote the articles once they are set To Web(or for old laid ones of course). Things like --> Editor or /editor should be removed at your convenience.
-Changed CFS wallpaper to holiday theme, because it's December. yay.




11.30.12 - 1.1.1
-Added search feature to thelionsroar.com
-Users can search by title, content or author
-If you search your own name by author, you can check how many articles you've written for the Roar! Scroll downward to the bottom of the page and see "results found". Most likely it is missing some articles, because sometimes "author" on CFS isn't always exactly your name. (Joe Jospeh). James has written 17; Kylie has written 18; Tom Haskin wrote a whopping 38. How many has everyone else written?



11.22.12 - 1.1.0
-You can now browse the Lion's Roar archives via the homepage. Currently ordered by section.
-Added new feature: jump to specific volume on section archive pages, as well as "back to top" links
